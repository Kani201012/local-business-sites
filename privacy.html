We understand that visiting the dentist involves sharing sensitive details about your health, and we are committed to protecting that information with the highest standards of care and confidentiality.

All patient records—including medical history, treatment notes, contact details (such as phone numbers, email addresses, and home addresses), insurance information, and payment records—are handled in strict accordance with applicable privacy laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States (or equivalent regulations in other regions). We use advanced encryption technologies for both storage and transmission of your data. Whether you're accessing our patient portal, receiving appointment reminders via text or email, or submitting forms online, your information is safeguarded through secure servers, firewalls, and industry-standard encryption protocols (such as TLS 1.3) to prevent unauthorized access.

We collect only the information that is reasonably necessary to provide you with high-quality dental care and to enhance your overall experience. This includes basic identifiers for scheduling appointments, verifying insurance coverage, coordinating treatment plans, processing payments, and following up on your care. For example, we may use your contact information to send timely reminders, confirmations, or important updates about your visits. We never gather unnecessary personal details, and we do not use your data for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

Importantly, we never share, sell, or disclose your protected health information to third parties except in very limited, legally permitted circumstances. These include situations required for your treatment (such as coordinating with specialists or labs), payment processing (with your insurer), healthcare operations (like quality reviews), or when mandated by law (e.g., public health reporting or court orders). Any third-party vendors or business associates we work with—such as billing software providers or secure cloud storage services—are carefully vetted and required to sign formal agreements that bind them to the same rigorous privacy and security standards we uphold.

Our team receives regular training on privacy best practices to ensure everyone understands their responsibilities. We maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards, including secure access controls, regular risk assessments, and protocols for handling any potential incidents. In the unlikely event of a data breach involving unsecured information, we follow strict notification procedures to inform affected individuals promptly and transparently.

You have rights regarding your information, including the ability to access, request corrections, or obtain a copy of your records (with reasonable fees where applicable). If you have questions, concerns, or wish to file a complaint about our privacy practices, please contact our Privacy Officer at [insert contact details]. We take every concern seriously and are dedicated to resolving it promptly.

At Urban Prime Dental, trust is the foundation of the care we provide. By choosing us, you can feel confident that your privacy is respected every step of the way—from your first appointment to ongoing wellness. We are grateful for the opportunity to serve you and remain steadfast in our commitment to safeguarding your personal health information.</div></section></main>
