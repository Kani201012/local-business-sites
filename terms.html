To support this, we have established clear guidelines regarding appointment cancellations, rescheduling, and procedural requirements.

Appointments must be cancelled or rescheduled at least 24 hours in advance. This notice period allows us to offer the reserved time slot to another patient who may need urgent care, helping us minimize wait times and maximize access to dental services in our community. Cancellations or changes with less than 24 hours' notice are considered late and may result in a cancellation fee (typically equivalent to a portion of the appointment cost, such as the standard consultation or procedure fee), unless the change is due to a genuine emergency, sudden illness, or unforeseen circumstance. In such cases, we kindly ask for documentation (e.g., a medical note) where applicable, and we will review each situation compassionately on a case-by-case basis. Repeated late cancellations or no-shows may lead to adjusted scheduling options, such as same-day or short-notice appointments only, to ensure the smooth operation of our practice.

We understand that unexpected events can occur, and we appreciate your cooperation in notifying us as soon as possible—preferably by phone during office hours or through our secure patient portal. Early communication helps us serve everyone more effectively and keeps our schedule running on time for all patients.

Additionally, Urban Prime Dental reserves the right to reschedule appointments in the event of genuine emergencies, such as urgent cases requiring immediate attention (e.g., severe pain, trauma, or infection that cannot wait). In these rare situations, we will make every effort to contact affected patients promptly, offer alternative times as soon as possible, and accommodate your needs with priority. Our team is dedicated to minimizing any inconvenience this may cause.

For all surgical procedures—including extractions, implants, periodontal surgery, or any treatment involving anesthesia, incisions, or potential risks—we require a signed informed consent form prior to proceeding. This form outlines the nature of the procedure, expected benefits, possible risks and complications (such as bleeding, infection, swelling, nerve involvement, or rare adverse reactions), alternatives to treatment, and what to expect during recovery. Signing the form confirms that you have had the opportunity to ask questions, understand the information provided, and agree to move forward voluntarily. This step aligns with ethical standards, legal requirements in Saudi Arabia (including guidelines from the Ministry of Health and Saudi Commission for Health Specialties), and best practices in patient-centered care. Verbal explanations are always provided, and we encourage you to bring a family member or ask for clarification at any time.

These policies are in place to promote mutual respect between our practice and our valued patients. By adhering to them, we can continue delivering high-quality, timely dental care in a supportive environment. If you have any questions about our cancellation policy, fees, rescheduling process, or consent requirements, please speak with our front desk team or contact us directly—we are here to help.

Thank you for your understanding and partnership in keeping our schedule efficient and our care exceptional.</div></div></main>
